"O" is not the letter O; it is a circle representing the cyclical development line of humanity within the universe. The blank space at the centre represents the purest consciousness, the most valuable in the universe, while the outer circle represents a quantum world connected through humanity, and the macroscopic world... Therefore, to be precise, this outer-core system is designed to simulate a decentralised universe. Perhaps in such a world, magic truly exists, haha! You are free to define it. Unlike GNU, this initiative aims to meet the operational needs of small developers as much as possible. Meanwhile, the outer-core design also provides a solid foundation for multiple ecosystems. If successful, it could serve as a model for addressing imbalances in technological development.
